## Inspiration
Time and again we have observed an on-the-spot need for borrowing daily devices, enquiring about essential services, and local businesses/stores. Proper advice for such small queries is rarely available on the web, and this is where a community helps. A forum/social network for a neighborhood can aid users to identify new local stores around them and get instant help regarding essential services. This not only makes the community engaging and accommodating but also supports local vendors and professionals.

## What it does
**Aas Paas** is a **neighborhood-friendly application** that aims to create strong community bonds and support local businesses. The application is a platform for all the users in the vicinity to help each other with queries like the need for some supplies, services, or professionals. Aas Paas acts as a community social network, with built-in features for conversing with neighbors and following their activity. Our project supports local businesses, essential service providers and in turn benefits every user.

## How we built it
**Aas Paas** is built on the **Flutter** framework using **Dart**. Flutter enables us to write a single piece of code for all platforms (**Android, iOS, and Web**). The backend connectivity to connect different users of a neighborhood to each other is built on **Firebase**. Firebase and **Firestore** are components of **Google Cloud Services** which we have also used for **Google Cloud Messaging**.
A user model is used with several Dart widgets, compiled into different screens of our mobile application. We have made a close-to-production User Interface for a comforting User Experience.
PROBLEM - Amid this crisis, large gatherings and stampedes at grocery stores totally defy the purpose of this lockdown. Social distancing is key to staying safe and crowding at general stores exposes the people to this virus. This rush for daily supplies could result in further spread of the pandemic. The problem is to prevent crowds while maintaining regular supply to all.

## What's next for Aas Paas
Future Prospects for our application are extensive. Some are - 
1. An additional feature to schedule society meetings and interactive sessions between neighbors.
2. Alert Notifications for recent posts
3. Business Promotions section for local businessmen and professionals.
